# TNAS-Client
This project contains a very simple, easy to use, TNAS API Client written in Python 3.6.

TNAS is used for Toll Free Number Portability in New Zealand.

This library requires no third-party libraries, and supports TLS1.2 SSL. 

For Windows users:
  - Install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) or later
  - Clone this library using a Git client, such as [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) for Windows (Or simply download using the green link above)
  - You can then either use Python from command line to execute the example.py script, or I would recommend using an IDE like PyCharm which is a lot more user-friendly
